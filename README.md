**MSSQL Python Chatbot**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our tutorial on building a natural language SQL chatbot using GPT-4! This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot capable of interpreting natural language queries, generating SQL queries, and fetching results from a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database. The project is intuitive and user-friendly, leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model and an interactive Streamlit GUI.



Features
Natural Language Processing: Leverages GPT-4 to understand and respond to user queries in natural language.
SQL Query Generation: Dynamically generates SQL queries tailored to user input.
Database Interaction: Connects to MSSQL databases for executing queries and retrieving results.
Streamlit GUI: Provides a sleek and accessible interface built with Streamlit, catering to users of all skill levels.
Python-Based: Entirely developed in Python, following modern development practices.
How It Works
The chatbot seamlessly processes user queries by:

Converting natural language input into SQL queries with GPT-4.
Executing the generated SQL query on a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database.
Presenting the retrieved results back to the user in a conversational format.
This integration involves GPT-4 for query generation, database interaction through Python, and an engaging GUI via Streamlit.
